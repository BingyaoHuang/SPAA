Please watch the [IEEE VR'22 presentation][8] for a quick introduction of our work.

## Introduction

PyTorch's implementation of SPAA ([paper][1]). Please refer to [supplementary material (~66MB)][2] for more results.

## Prerequisites

* PyTorch compatible GPU with CUDA 11.7
* Conda (Python 3.9)
* Other packages are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

## Usage
#### Reproduce paper results
1. Create a new conda environment:
   ```
   conda create --name spaa python=3.9
   activate spaa       # Windows
   conda activate spaa # Linux
   ```
2. Clone this repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BingyaoHuang/SPAA
   cd SPAA
   ```
3. Install required packages by typing
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Download SPAA [benchmark dataset (~3.25 GB)][3] and extract to [`data/`](data), see [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for more details.
5. Start **visdom** by typing the following command in local or server command line:
   `visdom -port 8097`
6. Once visdom is successfully started, visit [`http://localhost:8097`](http://localhost:8097) (train locally) or `http://server:8097` (train remotely).
7. Open [`reproduce_paper_results.py`](src/python/reproduce_paper_results.py) and set which GPUs to use. An example is shown below, we use GPU 0.
   `os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'`
8. Run [`reproduce_paper_results.py`](src/python/reproduce_paper_results.py) to reproduce benchmark results.
   ```
   cd src/python
   python reproduce_paper_results.py
   ```

#### Compare the three projector-based attackers in your setups
1. Finish the steps above.
2. Open `main.py` and follow the instructions there. Execute each cell (starting with `# %%`) one-by-one (e.g., use PyCharm **Execute cell in console**) to learn how to set up your projector-camera systems, capture data, train PCNet/CompenNet++, perform the three projector-based attacks (i.e., SPAA/PerC-AL+CompenNet++/One-pixel_DE), and generate the attack results.
3. The results will be saved to `data/setups/[your setup]/ret`
4. Training results of PCNet/CompenNet++ will also be saved to `log/%Y-%m-%d_%H_%M_%S.txt` and `log/%Y-%m-%d_%H_%M_%S.xls`.
